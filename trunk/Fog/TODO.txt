TODO
====

[ ] Fog/Core:
    [ ] Remove allocPolicy and AllocPolicy enums, all detach functions must return err_t
        instead
    [ ] Fog::RegExp - use TRex
    [ ] Fog::String - not completed yet, add Locale support to group separators
    [ ] Fog::TextCodec - not completed yet
    [ ] StringUtil::some utf functions not completed yet
    [ ] Fog::BitArray - fix
    [ ] Temporary...<N>::free sometimes not frees the memory ?

[ ] Painter
    [ ] Text transform
    [ ] Text over path
    [x] Patterns support
    [ ] Patterns transform
    [ ] Text in path support
    [x] Line dashes
    [ ] Image transform
    [ ] Introduce save() / restore()
    [ ] Introduce setClipPath() / restoreClip()
    [ ] Reduce using of malloc/free in painter. All painter allocations should be pooled to maximize
        performance. Something like zone objects (see AsmJit) can be introduced, because lifetime of
        painter created objects is short.
[ ] Image
    [ ] Add some effects from qimageblitz?
    [ ] DOT line
    [ ] WU-Antialiased line
    [ ] Fill trapezoid, using rasterizer from pixman with ability to set color for each corner
    [ ] Render text using Font::getGlyphs
    [ ] ColorMatrix transformations
    [ ] Scaling
[ ] Font
    [ ] Make caching work
    [ ] Fix issue that this code """Font font; font.setSize(80);""" takes too long (3ms on my machine)
        due to incorrect cache control ?
    [ ] Ability to render to 'Path'
[ ] Raster
    [ ] Remove templated functions in Raster_C.cpp. It's needed to specialize code for each operation
        and pixel format, because specialized functions for ARGB32 / PRGB32 formats can be sometimes
        smaller and faster (template based ones are large).
    [ ] Write MMX composite functions
    [ ] Write SSE2 composite functions
    [ ] Linear gradient can be calculated by SSE2, think about it! The instructions pmax pmin, pcmpgt
        can be used in increments
    [ ] Introduce compositing on RGB32/RGB24 images again. This shouldn't be hard, because many
        combinations will degrade into over/src/NOP. I like the idea that I can set CompositeAdd
        and make some effects in UI rendering.
    [ ] Introduce compositing on A8 images.
