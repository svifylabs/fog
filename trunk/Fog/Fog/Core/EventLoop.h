//! A EventLoop is used to process events for a particular thread. There is at

//!
//! Events include at a minimum @c Task instances submitted to postTask or those
//! managed by @c Timer. Depending on the type of event loop other events such
//! as UI messages may be processed. On Windows APC calls (as time permits) and
//! signals sent to a registered set of HANDLEs may also be processed.
//!
//! Unless otherwise specified, a @c EventLoop's methods may only be called on
//! the thread where the @c EventLoop's run method executes (this is owner thread).
//!
//! Please be SURE your task is reentrant (nestable) and all global variables
//! are stable and accessible.

{
  EventLoop(const String& type);
  virtual ~EventLoop();

  //! notifications immediately.
  bool addNativeEventListener(NativeEventListener* listener);

  //! @brief Remove a native event listener. It is safe to call this
  //! method while an observer is receiving a notification callback.
  bool removeNativeEventListener(NativeEventListener* listener);

  //! @brief The @c run() method is called to enter the event loop's run loop.
  //!
  //! Within the method, the event loop is responsible for processing native
  //! events as well as for giving cycles to the tasks periodically. The event
  //! loop should take care to mix own events with native event processing
  //! so neither type of event starves the other of cycles.
  //!
  //! The anatomy of a typical run loop:
  //!
  //! @verbatim
  //! for (;;) {
  //!   didWork |= _doWork();
  //!   if (_quitting) break;
  //!
  //!   didWork |= _doDelayedWork();
  //!   if (_quitting) break;
  //!
  //!   if (didWork) continue;
  //!
  //!   didWork = _doIdleWork();
  //!   if (_quitting) break;
  //!
  //!   if (didWork) continue;
  //!
  //!   _waitForWork();
  //! }
  //! @endverbatim
  //!
  //! Here, @c _doInternalWork() is some private method of the event loop that is
  //! responsible for dispatching the next native event (this can be UI event,
  //! IO event, etc). @c _waitForWork() is a protected method that simply blocks
  //! until there is more work of any type to do.
  //!
  //! Notice that the run loop cycles between calling @c _doInternalWork(),
  //! @c _doWork(), and @c _doDelayedWork() methods. This helps ensure that
  //! neither work queue starves the other. This is important for event loops
  //! that are used to drive animations, for example.
  //!
  //! Notice also that after each callout to foreign code, the run loop checks
  //! to see if it should quit. The quit() method is responsible for setting
  //! this flag. No further work is done once the quit flag is set.
  //!
  //! @note Care must be taken to handle @c run() being called again from within
  //! any of the callouts to foreign code. Native event loops may also need to
  //! deal with other native event loops being run outside their control
  //! (e.g., the MessageBox API on Windows pumps UI messages!). To be specific,
  //! the callouts (@c _scheduleWork() and @c scheduleDelayedWork()) MUST still
  //! be provided even in nested sub-loops that are "seemingly" outside the
  //! control of this event loop. @c _doWork() in particular must never be
  //! starved for time slices unless it returns false (meaning it has run out
  //! of things to do).
  virtual void run();

  //! Process all pending tasks, windows messages, etc., but don't wait/sleep.
  //! Return as soon as all items that can be run are taken care of.
  virtual void runAllPending();

  //! @brief Quit immediately from the most recently entered run loop.
  //!
  //! Signals the @c run() method to return after it is done processing all
  //! pending events. This method may only be called on the same thread that
  //! called @c run(), and @c run() must still be on the call stack.
  //!
  //! Use @c QuitTask() if you need to quit another thread's @c EventLoop, but
  //! note that doing so is fairly dangerous if the target thread makes nested
  //! calls to @c run(). The problem being that you won't know which nested
  //! run loop you are quiting, so be careful!
  virtual void quit();

  //! The @c postTask() family of methods call the task's run() method
  //! asynchronously from within a event loop at some point in the future.
  //!
  //! With the @c postTask() variant, tasks are invoked in FIFO order,
  //! inter-mixed with normal UI or IO event processing. With the
  //! @c postTask() with delay larger than zero variant, tasks are called after
  //! at least approximately delay have elapsed.
  //!
  //! The EventLoop takes ownership of the @a task, and deletes it after it has
  //! been run.
  //!
  //! @note These methods may be called on any thread.  The Task will be invoked
  //! on the thread that executes @c run() (event loop owner thread).

#if defined(FOG_OS_WINDOWS)

//! @c WinEventLoop implements a "traditional" Windows message pump. It
//! contains a nearly infinite loop that peeks out messages, and then
//! dispatches them. Intermixed with those peeks are callouts to _doWork() for
//! pending tasks and _doDelayedWork() for pending timers. When there are no
//! events to be serviced, the event loop goes into a wait state. In most cases,
//! this message pump handles all processing.
//!
//! However, when a task, or windows event, invokes on the stack a native dialog
//! box or such, that window typically provides a bare bones (native?) message
//! loop. That bare-bones message loop generally supports little more than a
//! peek of the Windows message queue, followed by a dispatch of the peeked
//! message. EventLoop extends that bare-bones message pump to also service
//! tasks, at the cost of some complexity.
//!
//! The basic structure of the extension (refered to as a sub-loop) is that a
//! special message, EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK, is repeatedly injected into the
//! Windows Message queue. Each time the EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK message is 
//! peeked, checks are made for an extended set of events, including the 
//! availability of tasks to run.
//!
//! After running a task, the special message EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK is again
//! posted to the Window's Message queue, ensuring a future time slice for
//! processing a future event. To prevent flooding the Window's Message queue,
//! care is taken to be sure that at most one EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK message
//! is evet pending in the Window's Message queue.
//!
//! There are a few additional complexities in this system where, when there
//! are no tasks to run, this otherwise infinite stream of messages which drives
//! the sub-loop is halted. The loop is automatically re-started when tasks are
//! queued.
//!
//! A second complexity is that the presence of this stream of posted tasks may
//! prevent a bare-bones message loop from ever peeking a WM_PAINT or WM_TIMER.
//! Such paint and timer events always give priority to a posted message, such
//! as EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK messages. As a result, care is taken to do some
//! peeking in between the posting of each EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK message
//! (i.e., after EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK is peeked, and before a replacement
//! EVENT_LOOP_WM_HAVE_WORK is posted).
//!
//! @note Although it may seem odd that messages are used to start and stop
//! this flow (as opposed to signaling objects, etc.), it should be understood
//! that the native message loop will only respond to messages. As a result, it
//! is an excellent choice. It is also helpful that the starter messages that
//! are placed in the queue when new task arrive also awakens _doRunLoop().
